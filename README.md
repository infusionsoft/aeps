# API Enhancement Proposals

**TL;DR:** AIPs are lots of documents on how we do APIs.

## Overview

AEP stands for **API Enhancement Proposal**, which is a design document
providing high-level, concise documentation for API development. The goal is
for these documents to serve as the source of truth for API-related
documentation at Thryv and the way API teams discuss and come to consensus on
API guidance. The program is named and styled after Python's enhancement
proposals (PEPs) which have seemed to work pretty well over the years.
