# Test AEP with Reference-Style Links

This is a test AEP file with various reference-style links to test the fix
script.

## Valid Reference-Style Links

### Good reference-style links (should pass)

[aep.dev]: https://aep.dev/
[github-maintainers]:
  https://github.com/aep-dev/aep.dev/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md
[long-running operations]: ./0151
[errors]: ./0193

## Invalid Reference-Style Links

### Reference-style links with AEP identifiers (should be fixed)

aep-122 aep-4 aep-151 aep-193

### Reference-style links with .md extension (should be fixed)

## Usage of Reference Links

You can reference [aep.dev][] and [long-running operations][] in the text. Also
[aep-122][] and [aep-120][] should be fixed.
