# OpenAPI

This AEP describes the usage of OpenAPI within the AEPs and AEP-compliant APIs.

## Guidance

### OAS versions

AEP-compliant APIs **must** document their HTTP APIs using the [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)][], version 3.

Upon release of new minor versions of the OAS 3 specification, AEP-compliant
APIs **should** update their specification to use these new versions within 12
months of the release of that version.

If your API is built using the [Keap Micronaut BOM], the OAS version and YAML file generation is automatically handled
by the BOM.

[OpenAPI Specification (OAS)]: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/
