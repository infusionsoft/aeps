# Glossary

This AEP defines common terminology.

## Guidance

The following terminology **must** be used consistently throughout AEPs.

### API

Application Programming Interface. This can be a local interface (such as an
SDK) or a Network API (defined below).

APIs define one or more operations upon resource types.

### API Backend

A set of servers and related infrastructure that implements the business logic
for an API Service.

### API Client

An API Client is a program or library that performs a specific task, or set of tasks, by calling an API. It can also
include generic tools, such as CLIs, that expose the API in a user-accessible fashion or operate on resource data at
rest.

Examples of clients include the following:

- Command line interfaces
- Libraries, such as an SDK for a particular programming language
- Scripts that operate on a JSON representation of a resource after reading it
  from an API
- Tools, such as a [Declarative client][]
- Visual UIs, such as a web application

### AEP Edition

A specific edition of the AEP specification. This is a specific collection of
AEP guidance that will not change, annotated with the year (e.g., aep-2025). See
[editions](/editions) for more information.

### API Definition

A well-structured representation of an API.

### API Endpoint

Refers to a network address that an API uses to handle incoming requests. One
API may have multiple endpoints, such as `https://pubsub.example.com` and
`https://content-pubsub.example.com`.

### API Gateway

One or more services that together provide common functionality across API
services, such as load balancing and authentication.

### API Method

An individual operation within an API. It is typically represented in Protocol
Buffers by an `rpc` definition, or in HTTP via a `method` and a `path`.

### API Name

The name by which to refer to an API.

See [API Name](/apis#api-name)

### API Request

A single invocation of an API Method. It is often used as the unit for billing,
logging, monitoring, and rate limiting.

### API Resource

An entity upon which one or more methods can operate.

### API Resource Type

The type of API resource. It is globally unique within an API.

### API Service

An implementation of an API, exposing API methods on one or more network
addresses.

### Consumer

Either a programmatic client or a user that consumes an API. This term should
be used when a statement refers broadly to both programs and users.

### Collection

A collection represents a discrete set of resources of a specific type. A
resource may have one or more collections, with each collection having its own
parent.

### Declarative Clients

Declarative Clients, also known as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), describes a
category of clients that consumes a markup language or code that represents
resources exposed by an API and executes the appropriate imperative actions to
drive the resource to that desired state. To determine what changes to make and
if a set of updates was successful, a declarative client compares server side
resource attributes with client-defined values. The comparison feature ensures
accuracy of a creation or an update, but it requires services to treat the
client set fields as read-only and diligently preserve those values.

Examples of complexities that declarative clients abstract away include:

- Determine the appropriate imperative action (create / update / delete) to
  achieve desired state.
- Ordering of these imperative actions.

[Terraform][] is an example of such a client.

### Resource ID

The unique identifier for a resource, within its parent collection. For
example, in the following resource path:

```
/publishers/consistent-house/books/pride-and-prejudice
```

There are two resource IDs:

- `consistent-house`, which is the id of the publisher.
- `pride-and-prejudice`, which is the id of the book.

See [paths](/paths#resource-id) for more information.

### Root collection

A [collection](#collection) that does not have any parent collections. For
example, `/users/`.

### Root Resource

A root resource is a resource for which a collection exists that has no
parents. In other words, it is a resource that has a collection that appears at
the root of a resource hierarchy.

A root resource may also appear as a child of another resource: for example, a
music streaming service may have global shared playlists (e.g. "top
trending"), but may also have playlists nested under a user. In this case, a
playlist is still considered a root resource, since the collection with the
glocal shared playlists has no parents.

### Schema

A schema describes the structure of the request or response of an
[API method](#api-method), or a [resource](#api-resource). It refers both to an
OpenAPI schema and a protobuf message.

### User

A human being which is using an API directly, such as with cURL. This term is
defined to differentiate usage in the AIPs between a human _user_ and a
programmatic _client_.

### Network API

An API that operates across a network of computers. Network APIs communicate
using network protocols, including HTTP, and are frequently produced by
organizations separate from those that consume them.
