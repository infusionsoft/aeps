# Update

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `PATCH` or `PUT` request to a
resource's URI (for example, `/v1/publishers/{publisher_id}/books/{book_id}`)
in order to update that resource.

Resource-oriented design AEP-121 honors this pattern through the `Update`
method (which mirrors the REST `PATCH` behavior). These methods accept the URI
representing that resource and return the resource.

Also see the [apply](/apply) method, with guidance on how to implement `PUT`
requests.

## Guidance

APIs **should** provide an update method for resources unless it is not
valuable for users to do so. The purpose of the update method is to make
changes to the resources without causing side effects.

### Operation

- The method **should** support partial resource update, and the HTTP verb
  **should** be `PATCH`.
- The operation **must** have [strong consistency][].
- Some resources take longer to be created than is reasonable for a regular API
  request. In this situation, the API should use a
  [long-running operation](/long-running-operations).
- The response schema **must** be the resource itself.
  - The response **should** include the fully-populated resource, and **must**
    include any fields that were sent and included in the update mask unless
    they are input only (see AEP-203).

{% tab proto %}

{% sample '../example.proto', 'rpc UpdateBook' %}

Update methods are specified using the following pattern:

- The method's name **must** begin with the word `Update`. The remainder of the
  method name **must** be the singular form of the resource's name.
- The request schema's name **must** exactly match the RPC name, with a
  `Request` suffix.
- The request's `path` field **must** map to the URI path.
  - The `path` field **must** be the only variable in the URI path.
- There **must** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation, and it
  **must** map to the resource field in the request message.
  - All remaining fields **should** map to URI query parameters.
- There **should** be exactly one `google.api.method_signature` annotation,
  with a value of `"{resource},update_mask"`.

{% tab oas %}

```http
PATCH /v1/publishers/{publisher_id}/books/{book_id} HTTP/2
Host: bookstore.example.com
Accept: application/merge-patch+json
{
  "title": "Pride and Prejudice",
  "author": "Jane Austen"
}
```

- The method **must** adhere to the behavior specified in [IETF RFC 7396 - Json
  Merge Patch][].
- The method **must** support MIME types `application/merge-patch+json` to
  adhere to IETF RFC 7396.

{% endtabs %}

### Requests

Update methods implement a common request pattern:

- The request **must** contain a field for the resource.
  - The name of this field **must** be the singular form of the resource's
    name.
- The request **must not** contain any required fields other than those
  described in this section, and **should not** contain other optional fields
  except those described in this or another AEP.

{% tab proto %}

{% sample '../example.proto', 'message UpdateBookRequest' %}

- A `path` field **must** be included.
  - The field **must** be
    [annotated as required](/field-behavior-documentation).
  - The field **must** identify the [resource type][aep-120] that it references.
- The request message field for the resource **must** map to the `PATCH` body.
- The request message field for the resource **should** be [annotated as
  required][aep-203].
  - The field **must** identify the [resource type][aep-120] of the resource
    being updated.
- If partial resource update is supported, a field mask **must** be included.
  It **must** be of type `google.protobuf.FieldMask`, and it **must** be called
  `update_mask`.
  - The fields used in the field mask correspond to the resource being updated
    (not the request message).
  - The field **may** be required or optional. If it is required, it **must**
    include the corresponding annotation. If optional, the service **must**
    treat an omitted field mask as an implied field mask equivalent to all
    fields that are populated (have a non-empty value).
  - Update masks **must** support a special value `*`, meaning full replacement
    (the equivalent of `PUT`).

{% sample '../example.oas.yaml', '$.paths./publishers.post.requestBody' %}

### Responses

{% tab proto %}

{% sample '../example.proto', 'message Book' %}

{% tab oas %}

{% sample '../example.oas.yaml', '$.paths./publishers.post.responses.200' %}

{% endtabs %}

### Errors

See [errors][], in particular [when to use PERMISSION_DENIED and NOT_FOUND
errors][permission-denied].

In addition, if the user does have proper permission, but the requested
resource does not exist, the service **must** error with `NOT_FOUND` (HTTP 404)
unless `allow_missing` is set to `true`.

### Side effects

In general, update methods are intended to update the data within the resource.
Update methods **should not** trigger other side effects. Instead, side effects
**should** be triggered by custom methods.

In particular, this entails that [state fields][] **must not** be directly
writable in update methods.

### PATCH and PUT

**TL;DR:** AEP-compliant APIs generally use the `PATCH` HTTP verb only, and do
not support `PUT` requests.

We standardize on `PATCH` because many organizations update stable APIs in
place with backwards-compatible improvements. It is often necessary to add a
new field to an existing resource, but this becomes a breaking change when
using `PUT`.

To illustrate this, consider a `PUT` request to a `Book` resource:

```
    PUT /v1/publishers/123/books/456

    {"title": "Mary Poppins", "author": "P.L. Travers"}
```

Next consider that the resource is later augmented with a new field (here we
add `rating`, and use a protobuf example without loss of generality):

```proto
message Book {
  string title = 1;
  string author = 2;

  // Subsequently added to v1 in place...
  int32 rating = 3;
}
```

If a rating were set on a book and the existing `PUT` request were executed, it
would wipe out the book's rating. In essence, a `PUT` request unintentionally
would wipe out data because the previous version did not know about it.

### FieldMasks in proto and json merge-patch in HTTP

AEP recommends a specific diverence in behavior between the proto and the HTTP
interfaces. Specifically:

- The inclusion of the `update_mask` in the proto variant, requiring the user
  to explicitly specify fields to be updated.
- The usage of [IETF RFC 7396 - Json Merge Patch][IETF RFC 7396] for HTTP APIs.

This divergence in behavior is intentional, and exists for the following
reasons:

1. The update mask is a proto-specific concept, due to the lack of ability
   across all proto versions to differentiate if the user has explicitly
   populated a field or not. JSON has the ability to express whether a field is
   present (by omitting it from the JSON payload). Ultimately, this allows the
   field mask + proto pair and json to be translatable.
2. RFC 7396 is a popular and well-understood standard for HTTP. Introducing a
   new standard for HTTP would have made the AEP HTTP variant less idiomatic.
3. For HTTP-proto bindings, there is a way to generate the proto field mask
   from the fields present in the JSON request. This is what is recommended in
   the
   [API Design Patterns book, section 8.2 ](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/api-design-patterns/9781617295850/),
   describing the Google AIPs from which AEP-134 is forked. Implementations of
   gateway-grpc proto bindings such as
   [gateway-grpc](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/patch_feature/)
   support this translation.

Therefore, given the ability of these two different patch mechanisms to
interoperate while maintaining idiomatic practices, this divergence was
concluded to be the least worst option.

### Etags and preconditions

See [etags](/etags) for more information about adding headers and metadata such
as `ETag` and `If-Match` for supporting resource freshness validation and other
preconditions.
