# HEAD

The `HEAD` method is identical to [GET] except that the server doesn't return a message body in the response. `HEAD` is
used to obtain metadata about a resource without transferring its representation data, often for testing hypertext
links, checking resource availability, or finding recent modifications.

It is defined in [RFC 9110 Section 9.3.2].

## Guidance

### General requirements

* APIs **may** implement `HEAD` for resources that support [GET].
* `HEAD` requests **must** return the same response headers as an equivalent [GET] request would return, but without a
  response body.
* `HEAD` requests **must** be [safe] and [idempotent], following the same semantics as [GET].
* `HEAD` requests **must** return the same status codes as an equivalent [GET] request (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`,
  `403 Forbidden`).

### Use cases

Common use cases for `HEAD` include:

* Testing whether a resource exists without retrieving its full content
* Checking if a resource has been modified since a previous retrieval (via `Last-Modified` or `ETag` headers)
* Verifying hypertext links for validity
* Obtaining resource metadata such as content type and size before deciding whether to retrieve the full resource
