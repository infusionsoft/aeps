# Frequently Asked Questions

## What are the differences between AEPs and AIPs?

If you are familiar with Google's API Improvement Proposals
[google.aip.dev](https://google.aip.dev), or aep-dev's [API Enhancement Proposals](https://aep.dev),
then much of this content will be familiar.

However, our AEPs have notable philosophical differences, including:

- Our AEPs are written for HTTP REST APIs using JSON, while AIPs focus
  on gRPC. This makes these AEPs directly applicable to our company's API development
  without translation between protocols.
- Our AEPs provide organization-specific guidance tailored to our company's needs
  and standards, serving as our single source of truth for API design.

AEPs also have the advantage of hindsight from both AIPs and the broader AEP
project at [aep.dev](https://aep.dev), which makes it possible in some cases to
provide better guidance.
